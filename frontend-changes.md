# Frontend Changes: Dark/Light Theme Toggle

## Overview
Added a dark/light theme toggle feature to the Course Materials Assistant application, allowing users to switch between dark and light themes with smooth transitions.

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/index.html`
- **Added theme toggle button** in the header section with sun/moon icons
- **Made header visible** - previously hidden with `display: none`
- **Added SVG icons** for sun (light mode indicator) and moon (dark mode indicator)
- **Included accessibility attributes** (`aria-label`) for screen readers

### 2. `frontend/style.css`
- **Added light theme CSS variables** with appropriate colors for light mode:
  - Light background colors (`--background: #ffffff`)
  - Dark text for good contrast (`--text-primary: #1e293b`)
  - Adjusted surface and border colors
  - Maintained accessibility standards

- **Updated header styles** to be visible and positioned properly:
  - Flex layout with space-between for title and toggle button
  - Added transitions for smooth theme switching

- **Added theme toggle button styles**:
  - Circular button design with hover effects
  - Smooth scale animations on hover/active
  - Focus ring for accessibility
  - Icon transition animations

- **Enhanced transitions** throughout the application:
  - 0.3s transition duration for all theme-related changes
  - Applied to background colors, text colors, borders
  - Smooth icon rotation and opacity changes

### 3. `frontend/script.js`
- **Added theme management functions**:
  - `initializeTheme()`: Loads saved theme preference or defaults to dark
  - `toggleTheme()`: Switches between light and dark themes
  - `setTheme(theme)`: Applies theme and updates UI accordingly

- **Added event listeners** for theme toggle:
  - Click event for mouse interaction
  - Keyboard event (Enter/Space) for accessibility

- **Implemented theme persistence**:
  - Uses `localStorage` to remember user's theme preference
  - Automatically applies saved theme on page load

- **Added dynamic icon switching**:
  - Shows sun icon in dark mode (click to go to light)
  - Shows moon icon in light mode (click to go to dark)
  - Smooth opacity and rotation transitions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Theme Switching Mechanism
- Uses `data-theme="light"` attribute on `<html>` element for light mode
- Dark mode is default (no data-theme attribute)
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for easy theme switching
- All transitions are hardware-accelerated using CSS transforms

### Color Palette
**Dark Theme (Default):**
- Background: `#0f172a` (Dark slate)
- Surface: `#1e293b` (Slate)
- Text Primary: `#f1f5f9` (Light gray)
- Text Secondary: `#94a3b8` (Gray)

**Light Theme:**
- Background: `#ffffff` (White)
- Surface: `#f8fafc` (Very light gray)
- Text Primary: `#1e293b` (Dark slate)
- Text Secondary: `#64748b` (Medium gray)

### Performance Considerations
- All transitions use CSS for optimal performance
- Icons are inline SVG for fast rendering
- Theme preference cached in localStorage to avoid flash
- Minimal JavaScript for theme switching logic

## User Experience
- Theme preference is remembered across sessions
- Smooth transitions prevent jarring color changes
- Icons provide clear visual feedback of current theme
- Button is easily accessible but doesn't interfere with main content
- Works seamlessly with existing design language and components
